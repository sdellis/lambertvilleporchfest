    <h2>What is Lambertville Porchfest?</h2>
    <p>Lambertville Porchfest is a do-it-yourself community music festival.
    It is organized by (and for) Lambertville residents and features musical acts
    from all genres and all walks of life playing free shows on porches throughout
    the downtown neighborhood.</p>

    <h2>What safety precautions are being take to prevent the spread of COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>We are VERY serious about the need to social distance and wear a mask during the
    event. Porch owners and musicians may call you out if you are watching a performance
    without a face covering. Porch owners are asked to wipe mics and shared gear down with
    sanitizer between performances.</p>

    <h2>What are the rules?</h2>
    <p>In addition to the COVID-19 safety precautions, we ask all attendees to stand on
    the sidewalk or yard and not in the street unless the neighborhood has obtained a
    permit to close the street.</p>

    <h2>Will bathrooms be available?</h2>
    <p><strong>Attendees</strong> are responsible for finding their own bathrooms. There is a public
    bathroom in the parking lot next to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=12+Union+Street,+Lambertville,+NJ+08530">
12 N. Union Street</a>. There is also a public bathroom at the boat 
    launch down past The Lambertville Station (south end of town). We also encourage
    you to dine at one of the many fine restaurants in Lambertville, which have bathrooms for patrons.</p>
    <p><strong>Artists</strong> should negotiate bathroom access with the porch owners. In most cases,
    the hosts will be able to accommodate you, and make sure you are comfortable and your needs are met.</p>

    <h2>Is there a rain date?</h2>
    <p>Yes! In the case of heavy rains, we may postpone until Oct 17th. We will
    make this call the morning of and it will be posted on the website by 9am.
    Please plan accordingly for weather with protective layers, umbrellas,
    sunscreen, sufficient water etc.</p>

    <h2>Why is Porchfest restricted to downtown Lambertville?</h2>
    <p>This is our first year and we want to keep the events concentrated in the
    downtown neighborhood to make them easily accessible. We also want to support
    downtown businesses and restaurants which will benefit from the foot traffic.</p>

    <h2>How can I participate in Lambertville Porchfest?</h2>
    <p>There are lots of ways to be part of Porchfest! You can perform, host a show,
    volunteer, or just come out and appreciate all the amazing musical talent on display.</p>

    <h2>Who are the musicians? Can I play?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can play! All you need is a porch (or a stoop, or a patio that is
    visible from the sidewalk). You can <a href="https://forms.gle/5n9aYc6xWTY49Uji9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add your info to a Local Artists list</a> that
    Porch Hosts may consult to book their porches, but there is no guarantee that
    registration alone will find you a porch. The musicians of Lambertville Porchfest
    represent every genre and every level of experience. Within blocks of each other,
    you might find brass bands, emcees, bluegrass fiddlers, and jazz trios.
    Some musicians are professionals, others might have put together a new band,
    just for the occasion. Even if you’ve never performed publicly,
    Porchfest is a great way to try playing out in a fun, friendly, informal setting.</p>

    <h2>Who books the performers for Lambertville Porchfest? How do I get to perform?</h2>
    <p>All booking for Porchfest is done by porch hosts (typically, the residents of the
    house attached to a porch), not the Lambertville Porchfest Organizing Committee.
    If you’re a musician interested in playing at Porchfest we recommend talking
    to potential hosts (see below) in the neighborhood or
    <a href="https://forms.gle/5n9aYc6xWTY49Uji9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    adding your info to a Local Artists list</a> . And, of course, if you live in
    the neighborhood, you can always play on your own porch.</p>

    <h2>Who are the porch hosts? Can I host?</h2>
    <p>Anyone can host, if you have the rights/permission to use a porch in the neighborhood.
    To get on the map and schedule, <a href="https://forms.gle/uVCTS1iu8DAmCM3F7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register your porch</a>.
    If you need help finding artists to perform on your porch you can indicate that when you register and
    we will follow up with a list of local artists in search of a porch.</p>

    <h2>What are the responsibilities of hosting?</h2>
    <p>The porch hosts play an absolutely essential role in Porchfest. Porchfest is,
    in fact, not one event, but a collection of individually produced shows, and
    porch hosts are entirely responsible for the show they’re hosting.
    This includes booking the artists that will play on the porch, <a href="https://forms.gle/uVCTS1iu8DAmCM3F7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    registering the event</a>, notifying the neighbors on their block,
    and managing their show on the day of the event. This means that porch hosts
    should be comfortable with the legal liability of hosting a show on their
    porch and the responsibility of being a good neighbor to their immediate community.</p>

    <h2>What does Lambertville Porchfest provide to porch hosts?</h2>
    <p>Once you register your porch show via the sign-up form on our website,
    we’ll add it to our online map and include it the physical maps for the
    day of the event. We’ll keep you up to date with news and information,
    and offer some tips/suggestions for making your show a success.
    We’ll also provide you with a poster (or two) to put up on your porch so
    that everyone will know you’re hosting a show!</p>

    <h2>Can I bring my bike?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Biking is a great way to enjoy Porchfest and will ensure that you will
    be able to catch more of your favorite acts. This is a walking/biking tour.
    You will find that using a car to get around town is counterproductive. If you are
    joining us from out of town, plan to park it and walk. :)</p>

    <h2>Where can I find a map / lineup?</h2>
    <p>You can find an online interactive version of the map and schedule on our webite after
    September 26th.</p>

    <h2>Does this cost money to host/play/attend?</h2>
    <p>No!</p>

    <p>We do not charge any ticket price for audience members. We do not charge any
    registration fees for porch hosts. We certainly do not charge artists for the
    chance to perform! We provide a way to appreciate the
    artists by printing Venmo/PayPal accounts next to their names on the schedule.</p>

    <p>Some porch hosts may pay their artists. Some porches may
    provide a way to tip the artists performing.
    Each of these is at the discretion
    of the host. Because Porchfest is free for everyone, we are grateful for any
    donations you can afford. The money you donate is not tax-deductible, but it
    does all go directly to making this community event possible.</p>

    <h2>Who puts on this event?</h2>
    <p>This Porchfest is organized by Shaun Ellis, a 20 year Lambertville resident and local
    musician, along with significant help from Ryan Spreen, man about town and
    reformed musician.</p>

    <h2>How do I get involved if I want to be part of making Lambertville Porchfest happen?</h2>
    <p>Porchfest is an all-volunteer effort and we would love to have your help!
    Flyering, organizational outreach, and design work are done by volunteers.
    If you would like to learn more about ways in which you can donate your time
    to Porchfest, or if you are a local business that wants to provide a place for
    attendees to pick up maps/schedules the day of the event, send an email to
    shaun@sdellis.com.</p>
