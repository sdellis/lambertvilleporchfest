    <h2>What is Lambertville Porchfest?</h2>
    <p>Lambertville Porchfest is a do-it-yourself community music festival.
    It is organized by (and for) Lambertville residents and features musical acts
    from all genres and all walks of life playing free shows on porches throughout
    the downtown neighborhood.</p>

    <h2>What safety precautions are being take to prevent the spread of COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>We are VERY serious about the need to social distance and wear a mask during the
    event. Porch owners and musicians may call you out if you are watching a performance
    without a face covering. Porch owners are asked to wipe mics and shared gear down with
    sanitizer between performances.</p>

    <h2>What are the rules?</h2>
    <p>In addition to the COVID-19 safety precautions, we ask all attendees to stand on
    the sidewalk or yard and not in the street unless the neighborhood has obtained a
    permit to close the street.</p>

    <h2>What if my neighbors complain?</h2>
    <p>Lambertville has a noise ordinance strictly prohibiting loud music. If neighbors find the volume of a
    porch show to be a nuisance, they may call the police to enforce the noise ordinance. For this reason,
    among many, we strongly encourage you to talk to your neighbors BEFORE agreeing to host a show, making sure you
    address their concerns. Conversely, if a neighbor's show is too loud and disrupting your
    life, please kindly ask them to turn it down BEFORE calling the police. One of the beautiful things about Porchfest
    is that neighbors talk to neighbors and find solutions together. A successful and safe Porchfest (and community!)
    is contingent on neighbors NOT CALLING THE COPS ON EACH OTHER.</p>

    <h2>Will bathrooms be available?</h2>
    <p><strong>Attendees</strong> are responsible for finding their own bathrooms. There is a public
    bathroom in the parking lot next to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=12+Union+Street,+Lambertville,+NJ+08530">
12 N. Union Street</a>. The Justice Center (ACME building) on South Union Street has public restrooms. There is also a public bathroom at the boat
    launch down past The Lambertville Station (south end of town). We also encourage
    you to dine at one of the many fine restaurants in Lambertville, which have bathrooms for patrons.</p>
    <p><strong>Artists</strong> should negotiate bathroom access with the porch owners. In most cases,
    the hosts will be able to accommodate you, and make sure you are comfortable and your needs are met.</p>

    <h2>Is there a rain date?</h2>
    <p>No. In the case of disruptive or dangerous weather, porch hosts may decide to cancel or postpone their shows,
    but it's entirely up to the hosts. We encourage the hosts to update their Porchfest website page accordingly.
    Please plan accordingly for weather with protective layers, umbrellas, sunscreen, sufficient water etc.</p>

    <h2>Why is Porchfest restricted to downtown Lambertville?</h2>
    <p>Since we are just starting out, we want to keep the events concentrated in the
    downtown neighborhood to make them easily accessible. We also want to support
    downtown businesses and restaurants as they will benefit from the foot traffic.</p>

    <h2>How can I participate in Lambertville Porchfest?</h2>
    <p>There are lots of ways to be part of Porchfest! You can perform, host a show,
    volunteer, or just come out and appreciate all the amazing musical talent on display.</p>

    <h2>Who are the musicians? Can I play?</h2>
    <p>Yes, you can play! All you need is a porch (or a stoop, or a patio that is
    visible from the sidewalk). You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/517604519484347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    add your info to a Local Artists list</a> that
    Porch Hosts may consult to book their porches, but there is no guarantee that
    registration alone will find you a porch. The musicians of Lambertville Porchfest
    represent every genre and every level of experience. Within blocks of each other,
    you might find brass bands, emcees, bluegrass fiddlers, and jazz trios.
    Some musicians are professionals, others might have put together a new band,
    just for the occasion. Even if you‚Äôve never performed publicly,
    Porchfest is a great way to try playing out in a fun, friendly, informal setting.</p>

    <h2>Who books the performers for Lambertville Porchfest? How do I get to perform?</h2>
    <p>All booking for Porchfest is done by porch hosts (typically, the residents of the
    house attached to a porch), not the Lambertville Porchfest Organizing Committee.
    If you‚Äôre a musician interested in playing at Porchfest we recommend talking
    to potential hosts (see below) in the neighborhood or
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/517604519484347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    the Porchfest Musician/Porch Connector on Facebook</a>. And, of course, if you live in
    the neighborhood, you can always play on your own porch.</p>

    <h2>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a porch‚Äù</h2>
    <p>That‚Äôs okay! Even if you don‚Äôt have a porch we can figure something out! Do you have a stoop?
    How about a tiny lawn or walkway leading up to your front yard? We can call those honorary
    porches for this one day. If you‚Äôre still struggling to figure out where the show can take
    place, you may have to call up your Lambertville friends to see if you can host a show on
    their porch. If you‚Äôre still coming up short, check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/517604519484347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    the Porchfest Musician/Porch Connector
    on Facebook</a> to meet people with porches that want to have shows on them! Team up to book
    the porch show of your dreams!</p>

    <h2>‚ÄúI want to host but I need to book musicians‚Äù</h2>
    <p>We‚Äôve got you covered. We created <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/517604519484347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    the Porchfest Musician/Porch Connector on Facebook</a>
    for just this scenario. There you will find many excited musicians who would love to be
    asked to play a show on your porch. You can even post that you have a porch and let the
    musicians come to you!</p>

    <h2>What are the responsibilities of hosting?</h2>
    <p>The porch hosts play an absolutely essential role in Porchfest. Porchfest is,
    in fact, not one event, but a collection of individually produced shows, and
    porch hosts are entirely responsible for the show they‚Äôre hosting.
    This includes <a href="https://forms.gle/aWaNMDc4u1QrpGLy6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    registering your porch</a>, booking the artists that will play on the porch, notifying the neighbors on their block,
    and managing their show on the day of the event. This means that porch hosts
    should be comfortable with the legal liability of hosting a show on their
    porch and the responsibility of being a good neighbor to their immediate community.</p>

    <h2>What does Lambertville Porchfest provide to porch hosts?</h2>
    <p>Once you register your porch show via the sign-up form on our website,
    we‚Äôll add it to our online map and include it the physical maps for the
    day of the event. We‚Äôll keep you up to date with news and information,
    and offer some tips/suggestions for making your show a success.
    We‚Äôll also provide you with a poster (or two) to put up on your porch so
    that everyone will know you‚Äôre hosting a show!</p>

    <h2>Can I bring my bike?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Biking is a great way to enjoy Porchfest and will ensure that you will
    be able to catch more of your favorite acts. This is a walking/biking tour.
    You will find that using a car to get around town is counterproductive. If you are
    joining us from out of town, plan to park it and walk. :)</p>

    <h2>Where can I find a map / lineup?</h2>
    <p>You can find an online interactive version of the map and schedule on our website after
    September 26th.</p>

    <h2>Does this cost money to host/play/attend?</h2>
    <p>No!</p>

    <p>We do not charge any ticket price for audience members. We do not charge any
    registration fees for porch hosts. We certainly do not charge artists for the
    chance to perform! We provide a way to appreciate the
    artists by printing Venmo/PayPal accounts next to their names on the schedule.</p>

    <p>Some porch hosts may pay their artists. Some porches may
    provide a way to tip the artists performing.
    Each of these is at the discretion of the host. Because Porchfest is free for everyone, we are grateful for any
    donations you can afford. The money you donate is not tax-deductible, but it
    does all go directly to making this community event possible.</p>

    <h2>Can my Lambertville-based business participate in Porchfest?</h2>
    <p>Yes! For starters, you can participate as a porch host. You may also want to consider offering a
    small "grab-and-go" meal for the day so attendees can pick up a bite on the way to see their favorite
    performers.</p>

    <h2>Who puts on this event?</h2>
    <p>This Porchfest is organized by volunteers within the community, hosts, and performers.</p>

    <h2>How do I get involved if I want to be part of making Lambertville Porchfest happen?</h2>
    <p>Porchfest is an all-volunteer effort and we would love to have your help!
    Flyering, organizational outreach, and design work are done by volunteers.
    If you would like to learn more about ways in which you can donate your time
    to Porchfest, or if you are a local business that wants to provide a place for
    attendees to pick up maps/schedules the day of the event, send an email to
    LambertvillePorchfest@gmail.com.</p>
