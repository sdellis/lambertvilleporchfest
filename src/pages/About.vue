        <p>Lambertville Porchfest is a do-it-yourself music and arts festival, featuring
        artists of all kinds expressing themselves on porches throughout the neighborhood.
        Created by and for Lambertville residents, the festival seeks to represent
        and celebrate the community’s broad talents and picturesque neighborhoods.</p>

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>To build, deepen and celebrate connections within our
    community by creating a platform for sharing the joys of live music and art.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.porchfest.org/">first Porchfest</a> was held in
    Ithaca, NY in 2007. Since then,
    Porchfests have sprung up in over 100 other US and Canadian cities,
    including San Francisco, Cleveland, Tucson, Philadelphia, Montréal and Ottawa.

      <p>This is the fifth Lambertville Porchfest, so it's up to us to make history happen again!
      We have no doubt that it will bring neighbors together, give
      local artists a platform to share their work, and help support Lambertville's
      downtown restaurants and businesses.
      </p>

    <h2>Artwork</h2>
    <p>The 2024 design for Lambertville Porchfest is still in the works. Stay tuned!</p>
