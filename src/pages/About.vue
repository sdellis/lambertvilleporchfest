        <p>Lambertville Porchfest is a do-it-yourself music festival, featuring
        musicians of all kinds playing free shows on porches throughout the neighborhood.
        Created by and for Lambertville residents, the festival seeks to represent
        and celebrate the communityâ€™s broad musical talents and picturesque neighborhoods.</p>

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>To build, deepen and celebrate connections within our
    community by creating a platform for sharing the joys of live music.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.porchfest.org/">first Porchfest</a> was held in
    Ithaca, NY in 2007. Since then,
    Porchfests have sprung up in over 100 other US and Canadian cities,
    including San Francisco, Cleveland, Tucson, Philadelphia, MontrÃ©al and Ottawa.

      <p>This is the second Lambertville Porchfest, so it's up to us to make history happen again!
      We have no doubt that it will bring neighbors together, give
      local artists a platform to share their music, and help support Lambertville's
      downtown restaurants and businesses -- all while being mindful of safety
      guidelines necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19.
      </p>

    <h2>Artwork</h2>
    <p>Each year a local artist contributes an annual Porchfest design. Our artwork this year
    was created by Anabel Bouza, and is a modern take on a treasure map that attendees can
    use to locate all the musical treasures and landmarks around town. You can support Anabel
    (who lost her job at Rojo's due to Ida) and get yourself some great Lambertville Porchfest 2021 merchandise at
