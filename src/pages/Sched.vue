        <p>Well-known local act, Spitune, in "duo" formation playing both covers and originals.
          Both weird/gnarly and sublime. They have also been described as a comedy act.
          Technically not true, but when these dudes get going the comedy just kind of happens.
          As a matter of fact, you never know what's going to happen.</p>
