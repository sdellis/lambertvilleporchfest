bio: >-
  Alyssa has a way with words. Each of her works is an internal still life; a
  pile of
              stuff on a table, arranged to illustrate what it's like to be a human bean wandering in the world.
              You will find yourself simulataneously smiling and crying to her playful and whimsical
              musings, all accompanied by baritone ukulele.
