bio: >-
  Christina Ward delivers her lyrical poetry like a humming bird plucking at
  your heart strings. She released a  four-song EP on Mint 400 records earlier
  this year, and was subsequently featured on WXPN's The Key local music show.


  Christina Will be sharing the stage and playing bass with Our Bodies Themselves, the brainchild of Nawi Avila. Part performance art, part serious musicianship, and part comedy, OBT is one of the most unique and creative acts I have ever seen, so please do yourself a favor and see Themselves for yourselves.
