title: Rachel Rosemarie
name: Rachel Rosemarie
bio: rachel rosemarie crafts deeply poetic songs that work through the
  complexities of relationships, identity, living with a disability, and coming
  to terms with all the unknowns of modern life. rachel's guitar style is
  soothing and novel -- she plucks out arpeggios like a harpist among soft jazz
  chord voicings. Her melodies are simultaneously beautiful and unsettling,
  treading like a golden carp in a sea of existential dread.
