bio: |-
  â€œDrama Cycle is a Lambertville, NJ based
  band that formed in 2020, experimenting with
  eclectic sounds and chasing the perfect blend
  between the unconventional and modestly
  accessible musical approaches, mixing
  uplifting and animated motifs with melancholy
  and grey space driven tones, and
  aggressiveness with subtleness, Drama
  Cycle has been a musical reflection of the
  aftermath of COVID, and will continue to
  evolve within musical explorations.
