bio: >-
  Heart of a singer-songwriter, soul of a composer, body of a rock band. Or
  something like that.\

  \

  As Deskjobs, New Jersey’s Drew Connelly makes guitar driven indie rock that hints at, but never leans too heavily on nostalgia.\

  \

  His latest release, I Guess That’s How It’s Always Been, mixes crunchy guitars, poppy hooks, and a dash of suburban ennui, detailing personal turmoils and anxieties while never taking himself too seriously.
