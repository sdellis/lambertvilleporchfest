name: NIGHT CAP
bio: Local group, NIGHT CAP, was founded in 2018 by a group of like-hearted
  musicians who became fast friends. Blending many styles of music including
  sounds from classic, indie and alternative rock, with blues, funk and a touch
  of jazz for good measure, the group plays original music and covers that they
  make their own.
