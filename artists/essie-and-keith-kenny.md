title: "'22  Keith Kenny"
name: " Keith Kenny"
bio: If the audience at a Keith Kenny show were to close their eyes for the
  performance they would swear that there was a full band on stage. The
  audience, however,Â is too busy dancing to the one-man acts layered guitar
  riffs, foot stomping percussion, and emotionally charged lyrics to even think
  about looking away. In recent years he has shared the stage with the likes of
  Keller Williams, Leon Russell, John Hammond Jr., New Riders of the Purple
  Sage, The Zen Tricksters and John Kadlecik (Further & Dark Star Orchestra).
