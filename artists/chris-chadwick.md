bio: The music of Chris Chadwick has its roots in the Greenwich Village folk
  scene, with generous helpings of jazz, blues, country, and classic R&B. Ray
  Charles, Marvin Gaye, Dr. John, Fred Neil, Tim Hardin, and Joe Cocker have all
  left an indelible imprint on Chrisâ€™s vocal style. Chris delivers an acoustic
