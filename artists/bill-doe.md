  Bill & Fred's Excellent Adventure is two guys from a band called Spitune doing
  their version of a rock and roll acoustic duet.


  Bill Fowler - Acoustic Guitar/Vocals\

  Fred Moore - Acoustic Guitar/Vocals\

  \

  They do both covers and originals. The covers range from Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, Doobie Brothers, Simon & Garfunkle, Jethro Tull, David Bowie, Willie Nelson, and Frank Zappa. Just to name a few. They have also been described as a comedy act. Technically not true but when these dudes get going the comedy just kind of happens. It usually involves audience members in some way. Plus you never know who will sit in or be playing with them.Â  Basically, anything can happen at a Bill & Fred show. Everyone always has an EXCELLENT time! Come check them out
