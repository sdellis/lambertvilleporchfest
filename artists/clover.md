title: "'22 CLOVER"
name: CLOVER
bio: CLOVER is a singer-songwriter originally from Lambertville, New Jersey.
  Captivating and perplexing, with vocals way bigger than her body, CLOVER wisps
  you away into her own sonic world. Inspired by the likes of Lake Street Dive,
  Lianne La Havas, Amy Winehouse, Carole King, and Joni Mitchell, she warmly
  welcomes you with a blend of soul, rock, and pop that echoes timelessness.
  Living in Brooklyn from 2018-2020, CLOVER frequently played shows at beloved
  venues like Rockwood Music Hall, Pianos, and Pete's Candy Store. After
  releasing her debut single “This Love” in early 2020, she decided to leave the
  city and travel around the country while safely bringing music to the public
  during the pandemic through street performance. From trailheads to
  mountaintops and cities to beaches, CLOVER has performed in 22 states. To see
  if CLOVER is playing in a public space near you, check her Instagram at

  song “I Don’t Use Your Name” arriving September 17th.
