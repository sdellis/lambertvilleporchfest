title: Bon Temp Tucker
name: Bon Temp Tucker
bio: The brain child of Oliver Dodge, Bon Temp Tucker is an amusing and
  irreverent acoustic-synth-folk project that blends lush synthetic arrangements
  with plucky acoustic guitar lines, and lyrics that tell stories ranging from
  thought provoking to heartfelt to just plain old funny.
