name: "Loose Panic: "
bio: " NJ based music project of Jarret Crawford. He combines influences from
  Americana and roots rock, 90s alternative, and various other influences to
  create sounds he thinks sound good together. He came back to playing and
  writing music after a 15 year hiatus during which he started a family and a
  career as a psychology professor. Now he tries to create music that deals with
  the feelings of anxiety, loss, anger and occasional joy that come with living
  in 21st century America. He has released two singles (streaming everywhere)
  and is set to release his first EP, In Hindsight, in 2022"
