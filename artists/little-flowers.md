bio: >
  Little Flowers delivers slow musings on love and life. The debut release,
  Glitter, serves up four tracks that melt with wistful questions and are
  seasoned with nostalgic reverie and wonder. Did we make the right choice? How
  did we end up here? Remember what it felt like to laugh? 


  If Glitter is an acoustic start to a brilliant career, Little Flowers' forthcoming material seals the deal with bigger arrangements and production.
